# Kuo's Repository Viewer
---

A very barebones repository viewer. To get started just upload this php file to public_html or whereever. 
The code is quite self-explanatory. files will get popped out to view, using google docs to preview files in pop out iframes.
remember to replace the "repository" with the folder you want to be viewed (script and folder should be under same parent)

TBA: Support for cdn bunny (bunny.net) and video/streaming support with more customizable interface (widgets and navbar)

Happy coding!
